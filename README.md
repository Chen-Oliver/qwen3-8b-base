# Qwen3-8B-Base

A simple from scratch PyTorch implementation of the `Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base` model, using pre-trained weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  **Dependencies:** Install the required packages using `uv`.
    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

2.  **Model Weights:** You'll need the `config.json` and the model weights for `Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base`. You can download them from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base).
    - Place `config.json` in the project root. There is already one included in this repo.
    - Download and place the model weight files (e.g., `.safetensors` and `model.safetensors.index.json`) into a `qwen3_weights/` directory.

### Running the Example

The `model.py` includes a simple demonstration when ran as a script
```sh
uv run model.py
```
This will run both greedy and sampling-based generation and print the output to the console.

## Architecture
- The Qwen3 line of models contains both Dense and Mixture of Expert Models. All models in this line utilize Grouped Query Attention.
- Qwen3-8B, like its smaller siblings (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B) is a dense model but one difference is that it doesn't utilize tie embedding.
- Qwen3 differs from Qwen2 in that it no longer uses a QKV bias and opts for a QK normalization step before applying attention. This is similar to the QK-norm used in [OlMo2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00656) but the norm is shared across the heads.


## Known Limitations
This is a simplified implementation and lacks many optimizations.
-  No batch support: single-prompt inference only
-  No KV Cache
-  No RoPE scaling
-  Precision differences
    - The [Huggingface implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/qwen3/modeling_qwen3.py#L51) uses a custom RMSNorm kernel that leads to slight precision differences with this implementation.

## Example Generations

The model produce varied outputs based on the generation strategy.
